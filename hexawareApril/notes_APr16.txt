Method Overloading : 

Using the same method w.r.t. Different parameters of
different data types. 

Here, the method name must be same. 


Types of memories. 

There are 2 types of memories as 

	1) STACK

	2) HEAP 

values types will be stored in STACK memory, and reference types will be stored in HEAP memory.

What are the methods of the Object class :
__________________________________________


the top level class in java is java.lang.Object, 

it has some predefined methods. 

toString() : This method will be called automatically, once you print the object, 
Its recommended that any data you have to print in class, please write code in toString() as every object will reuse this method. 

It represents the String representation.

hashCode()
getClass() 
equals() 


what is the differece between == and equals() 

How the Strings will be stored in memory. 

String w.r.t. data types, once you declare a string, at first, 
it checks the value is available in HEAP memory or not, if the value
is available then it would be pointing to the same memory location,
if the value is not available then it would be pointing to the different
memory location. Means, same value cannot be stored in different memory locations. 

When you give new keyword, then even value same it stores in different memory location. 

class Test
{
   int a,b;
   a=5;
   b=7;
}


The above code, will not compile, because a class contains only data members and member functions. 
You cannot write the code directly in the class, you have to write code in methods of the class. 
Above you wrote assignment statements in the class, that will not compile, 
But, if you want to give default values to the class variables, then we need the help 
Constructors. 

A constructor is a special member, that which used to initialize the member variables of the class, it is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 

	1) It will not contains any return type.

	2) It will not return any value.
	
	3) It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class created.

	4) A constructor can be overloaded. 

Types of Constructors :
_______________________


There are 2 types of constructors known as

	1) static constructor : These are called class constructors. Which are used to 
initilize the static variables of the class. These constructors are invoked automatically before control reaches the entry point. These constructors cannot be overloaded. {in java we don't have static constructor, we have use static {} as static constructor}
	
	2) instatic constructor : These are the constructors that which are invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. These constructors can be overloaded. 

static variables : 

int x;

static int x;

what is the difference between 

static variables are variables, that which retains values irrespective of type of object. Object not required to access these values, you can access them by using class name. 

Inheritance : 

Deriving a new entity from already existing entity known as inheritance,
through inheritance we can reduce the size of the program. 

class First {
...
...
...
}

class Second extends First {
...
...
...
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all public/protected and friendly
members of the First class.

final classes never be inherited
final methods cannot be overrided
final variables cannot be changed
